// The UI fonts -- every size the interface draws with, and the face they are
// drawn from.
//
// There are no fonts inside the binary. Everything is rendered through
// FreeType from the faces shipped in /usr/resource/sonix/fonts:
//
//   default.otf   MiSans Regular -- Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, kana, full CJK
//   bold.otf      optional bold weight for the headings; regular stands in
//                 when it is not there
//   korean.otf    Hangul, and the few Japanese marks MiSans lacks (the
//                 middle dot, the wave dash): a subset of Pretendard
//                 matched to MiSans
//   thai.otf      MiSans Thai
//   arabic.otf    MiSans Arabic
//   japanese.otf  FOT-Rodin, for kana, kanji and CJK punctuation when the
//                 interface is in Japanese
//
// MiSans is the face the interface was designed with, and the one it falls
// back to. Settable families are the others in the directory: Neon 80s on the
// V1, and Roboto Mono, Roboto Condensed, Inter and Barlow Semi Condensed
// (their files are optional -- a family the firmware does not carry is simply
// not offered). MiSans stays at the end of every chain, so a face with no
// Cyrillic, no kanji or no Hangul still draws the whole interface.
//
// The script faces each have an optional -bold file, like bold.otf.
// fonts_init() opens them once and builds one fallback chain per size.
// In Japanese, Rodin answers the CJK letters ahead of default (see fonts.c).
// FreeType maps the files -- nothing is decoded up front -- and rendered
// glyphs live in the shared FTC cache (LV_FREETYPE_CACHE_FT_GLYPH_CNT), so
// memory stays flat no matter how much text is on screen.
//
// Arabic is drawn right to left and in its joined forms by LVGL itself
// (LV_USE_BIDI and LV_USE_ARABIC_PERSIAN_CHARS in lv_conf.h); the face only
// has to carry the presentation forms, which MiSans Arabic does.
//
// These are real objects, not pointers, so `&font_ui_24` is a valid
// lv_font_t * at every call site. A face change fills them in again, which is
// why nothing may hold on to a font they were copied from.
