// drawing the artwork from right to left pulls the words in as the sleeve
// goes out, and drawing them back from left to right brings the sleeve back.
// The bar and the buttons stay exactly where they are. Everything else turns
// into Studio's look as the words come in: the blurred sleeve behind the whole
// screen, and the title and artist at the top. That blur is made in the
// background as soon as the artwork arrives, so it is there before the first
// swipe; Studio already has it, and there the words only take the sleeve's
// place.
//
// Timed lyrics follow the music, the line being sung lit in the accent colour
// and held in the middle of the column, the words moving up under it one line
// at a time; a finger scrolling them takes over for a few seconds, and a tap
// on a line plays from there. The column fades out at its top and bottom
// edges the way a scrolling title does at its ends.
