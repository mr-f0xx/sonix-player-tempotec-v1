// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The crate
//
// A column of records seen from the front. The one in the middle faces the
// viewer; the ones above and below are turned away from it, so each shows its
// outer edge nearer and its inner edge -- the one towards the middle --
// further. The inner edges converge and everything runs back towards a point
// behind the middle record.
//
// The turn is a projection, and it is continuous. A square tilted away from a
// camera does not project to a shorter square: the far edge is narrower than
// the near one, so the outline is a trapezoid, and the picture inside crowds
// towards the far edge. LVGL cannot draw that -- its transforms are affine, and
// no affine map narrows one edge against another -- so every frame of a drag
// works one out per pixel.
//
// The per-frame cost is bounded and constant. Only two records are ever part
// way through their turn -- the two either side of the middle, since anything a
// whole place away is already turned as far as it goes -- and their two heights
// always add up to the same number, so the work is exactly
//
//     CF_MID_W * (CF_MID_W + CF_LEAN_H)
//
// however fast the column is moving, and nothing at all when it is still. It
// also only happens while a finger is down.
//
// What gets turned is not the cover but the RECORD: a square built once per
// place, holding the card and, on it, the artwork -- or the album glyph when
// there is none. So the container turns with the picture, the glyph turns with
// the card, and a place whose cover has not arrived shows a record with nothing
// printed on it rather than somebody else's sleeve.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// The light the record in the middle throws.
//
// Not LVGL's box shadow, for two reasons.
//
// The first is where it stops. A box shadow reaches about half its blur plus
// its spread and then ends -- the fall is close enough to a straight line that
// the last step to nothing is a visible ring.
//
// The second is banding. The panel is RGB565, so a long ramp of one colour over
// artwork crosses a quantisation step every few pixels and each of those steps
// is a contour line. Nothing in a style can dither that, because nothing in a
// style knows where the pixel is.
//
// So the halo is painted here instead: one 8-bit alpha map, whose colour comes
// from the image's recolour and therefore still changes per album without the
// map being repainted, with a cubic fall to exactly nothing and an ordered
// dither of a few levels laid over it. An A8 image with no transform and no
// clipping radius is drawn by LVGL as a plain mask blend -- the same work a box
// shadow does, without the blur.
//
// It is painted around a rectangle sitting inside the record, so the light
// clears the sleeve on every side; with no vertical offset it rings the sleeve
// instead of pooling under it. That rectangle follows the record's height,
// which shrinks as the record turns, so a sleeve seen at an angle throws a
// flatter light than one facing the front.
