// The gate between the player, which is C, and the Game Boy core, which is C++.
//
// The core is Gearboy (Ignacio Sanchez, GPLv3+), dropped under src/gb/core
// unmodified -- see src/gb/README.md for why this one and not another. Only
// what is needed to run it is here: load a ROM, run a frame, hand back pixels
// and samples, take the keys, save the battery RAM.
//
// The core already produces RGB565, the framebuffer format of this device:
// between the emulator and the panel there is no conversion, only the 3x
// upscale.

// Super Game Boy, and an "SGB enhanced" cartridge switches it on by itself via
// byte 0x146 of the ROM: from then on RenderSGBFrame() draws 256x224 -- the
// Super Game Boy border around the picture -- into the caller's buffer. That is
// 57,344 pixels where 23,040 fit: 68 KB written past the end, every frame. The
// heap falls apart, the audio emits random frequencies and the device locks up.
//
// SGB is now disabled (gb_core_create tells the core so), so 160x144 would be
// enough in theory -- and "in theory" is exactly what was assumed before. The
// buffer is allocated at the worst-case size, 66 KB, so the problem cannot come
