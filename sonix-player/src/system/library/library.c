// the header is read directly instead -- a few bytes at a known place -- and
// only for the containers where the answer is not already settled by the
// extension:
//
//   FLAC  STREAMINFO, the first metadata block, at a fixed offset
//   WAV   the `fmt ` chunk, found by walking the chunk list
//   DSF   the `fmt ` chunk of a DSD stream, at a fixed offset
//   MP4   through the parser the player already has (rate, and ALAC's depth)
//   APE   the Monkey's Audio header, through apedec_probe()
//
// Anything else keeps zeros, and a row with zeros gets no badge: a wrong badge
// is worse than none. That is mp3, ogg, opus, raw aac -- all lossy, so the
// badge is decided by the container anyway -- and WavPack, which is the one
// lossless format left without an answer.
