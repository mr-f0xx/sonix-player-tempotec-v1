// The touchscreen as a gamepad, while a game runs.
//
// LVGL is not enough: its evdev driver is an INDEV_TYPE_POINTER -- one contact,
// one position, pressed or not. That allows one button at a time, and a Game
// Boy is held with two thumbs: running and jumping means right and A together,
// which is the game, not an edge case. So while playing, the screen changes
// owner: panel_touch_enable(false) parks LVGL's indev, and this module opens
// the same evdev node itself and reads the real multitouch protocol, which the
// patched touch driver reports -- gt9xx_touch.ko on the R3 Pro II,
// cst8xx_touch.ko on the R1. Both are uncapped by a script in tools/; PATCHES.md
// has the account of each.
//
// Zones come from outside in screen coordinates, and the reader thread decides
// which buttons are down: the mapping lives where the contacts are, not across
// a bridge to the UI. A finger sliding from the d-pad to A behaves correctly
// on its own, because the whole state is recomputed on every packet instead of
// tracking press and release. On the R1 a contact also outlives one packet
// without it, because its driver reports each finger on alternate scans.

// Not a Game Boy button: "open the in-game menu". It shares the mask because a
// zone is a zone, but the reader strips it before handing the buttons to the
// emulator and calls the menu callback instead.
//
// It is needed because while this module owns the screen LVGL's indev is off:
// no drawn object responds to touch, so the only way to have a command that is
// not a Game Boy button is a zone like any other. The menu sits in the middle
// of the game screen, where no hand rests while playing.
