// The running emulator: a thread producing frames, a framebuffer to look at,
// eight buttons to press.
//
// Pacing comes from the audio, not from a clock. Each emulated frame produces
// 738 samples per channel, and writing them to an ALSA PCM opened with a short
// buffer blocks until the card has consumed them, so the rate is the DAC
// crystal's -- exactly the Game Boy's 59.73 frames per second -- and video and
// sound cannot drift apart because one loop produces both. A computed usleep
// in place of that would slip a frame every few seconds.
//
// The framebuffer is already scaled up from the core's 160x144 -- three times
// on the 480-wide HiBy panels, once on the TempoTec V1, whose 240x320 panel is
// too narrow for 480 and has no scale in between that keeps a Game Boy pixel a
// square of whole panel pixels (see gearboy_set_scale). The scaling costs a
// millisecond and runs on the emulator thread, which has room for it, rather
// than on the UI thread, which does not -- and at 1x it is a plain copy, 46 KB
// instead of 414.

// is 240 wide, so three times 160 does not fit it and there is nothing between
// 1x and 3x that keeps every Game Boy pixel the same whole number of panel
// pixels: a fractional scale makes some pixels a row wider than their
// neighbours, which is what a Game Boy picture must not look like. The V1
// therefore shows the picture at one panel pixel per Game Boy pixel, and its
// page lays the controls out under it.
//
// Set once, by the page, before the first gearboy_start(): the framebuffer is
// sized from it and the page sizes its image from gearboy_frame_w() at the same
// moment. The default is 3, so a caller that never asks -- a test, or a board
// with no page of its own -- gets the HiBy picture.

//
// Audio is not closed: the PCM stays open and is fed silence, one frame at a
