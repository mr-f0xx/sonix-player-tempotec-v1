//   - Short-pressing the power button toggles the screen off/on. Music keeps
//     playing while the screen is off.
//   - After screen_off_timeout_ms with no user input the screen turns off on
//     its own (even while music is playing).
//   - Suspend-to-RAM. The stock standby executes `mem` 60 s after the screen
//     goes dark, but only after a real, awaited STOP of the audio pipeline
//     (command 0x203, wait for state 2, then `echo mem`). That sequence is
//     replicated here: suspend only when stopped, with no ALSA object alive,
//     Wi-Fi parked and sync() done. Disabled with [power] standby_mem = 0.
//
// The state machine runs on the LVGL/main thread via an lv_timer. Input
// threads (physical buttons) feed it through the thread-safe power_notify_*
// functions; touch input is tracked automatically via LVGL's inactivity clock.
//
// Wi-Fi parking in standby has no switch: a minute after the screen goes dark
// with nothing wanting the radio it powers itself down, and wifi_in_use() in
// power.c keeps it up while something is using it -- Qobuz, Tidal, podcasts,
// radio, AirPlay, DLNA, file transfer. The wait is [power] radio_park_seconds.
//
// Every knob here is driven at runtime from the settings pages, so the config is
// copied into the module and exposed through setters and getters.

// `end` closes it off. Both are no-ops on the host build.
